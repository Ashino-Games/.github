## 🌱 About Us

Ashino Games is an indie game studio founded from a love for storytelling, creativity, and playful worlds.  
The name **Ashino (葦野)** was chosen by the founder after being inspired by the anime *Remake Our Life!* — a story that sparked the decision to take game development seriously and start building original projects.

The kanji behind the name gives it an even deeper meaning:

- 葦 (*Ashi*) → “reed” or “bulrush” — tall grass found near rivers and wetlands.  
- 野 (*No*) → “field” or “wilderness.”  

Together, 葦野 means **“reed field”** or **“field of reeds”** — symbolizing calm, resilience, and growth in the open wild.
